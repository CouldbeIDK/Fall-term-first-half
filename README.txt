To run any of these programs, use ./"program name" <inputfile.txt >outputfile.txt

Proof of functionality is given for each sorting method, the corresponding txt file can be identified by its initials. (for example, HS.txt is the end result for a HeapSort).

All of the programs only print out the sorted list, with the exception of HeapSort, which also prints out the size of the array first.
